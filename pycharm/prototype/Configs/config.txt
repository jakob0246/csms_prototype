# configure parameters about the dataset here
#   - arff and csv files are supported
#   - if file is a CSV, have columns like: "<name>: <type>" where <type> can be "numerical" or "categorical" in the first row of the file
#   - numeric_categorials are categorials which should be treated as a number, e.g. values of the set {1, 2, 3, 4}
#   - csv_delimiter is only important if a csv file should be used
#   - class should contain the name of the class column
#   - missing_values can be "cca", "aca" or "impute", "impute" uses simple mean imputation, cca runs complete case analysis
#     and aca available case analysis TODO: auto mode? ("auto")
